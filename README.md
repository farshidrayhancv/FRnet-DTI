# FRnet-DTI: Convolutional Neural Networks for Feature Manipulation and Drug-Target Interaction Prediction
## Pre requisites
Tensorflow   
Tflearn    
Python v3.6    
Numpy    

## How it works
FRnet-1.py and FRnet-2.py holds the architecture of the models.    

Train-FRnet-1.py is used to geneterate deep 4096 representation of each instances.  

Train-FRnet-2.py uses the output of Train-FRnet-1.py as input for classification.  

PS: In our reseach we created new seperate csv file for each dataset with 4096 features and class values and used that as the dataset to train and test FRnet-2.
